# Applied Mathematics for Data Science
The repository provides all the material for my YouTube course "Applied Mathematics For Data Science", which you find on YUNIKARN.


# V1 Applied Mathematics for Data Science: An Introduction
This video introduces our new playlist dedicated to Applied Mathematics. We will cover a wide range of topics related to Data Science and Machine Learning. We will start with numbers, functions and recurrence relations. This course will use Python to solve mathematical problems.

# V2 Factorising Quadratics using Python
This video introduces the use of Python to tackle mathematical problems. We explore the factorisation of quadratic equations. We develop a Python code step-by-step using try-except, loops, functions and lists.

# V3 Log Functions: Properties & Transformations
This video introduces logarithm functions. Log functions appear in many areas of Data Science, including the transformation of variables that exhibit large positive outliers or maximum likelihood estimation. Log functions have several useful properties. The ln function is often used to simplify maximization problems (e.g., maximum likelihood). Why does it work?
